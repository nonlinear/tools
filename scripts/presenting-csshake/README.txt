A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/elrumordelaluz/pen/pHKcC.

 I made a serie of CSS classes to make shake your DOM.
Full project page: http://elrumordelaluz.github.io/csshake

You could used the pre-made classes or customize and create new ones to make shake the elementa as you want.

pre made classes:
class="shake"
class="shake shake-hard"
class="shake shake-slow"
class="shake shake-little"
class="shake shake-horizontal"
class="shake shake-vertical"
class="shake shake-rotation"
class="shake shake-opacity"
class="shake shake-crazy"

on everyone you could add:
- "freez" class if you want to freez the animation at the moment you leave the element
- "shake-constant" to make it constantly shaking
- "hover-stop" if you want to freez the constant shake on :hover

Here is the CSS*logo shaking as you want: http://cdpn.io/Kzeuv
