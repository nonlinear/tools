A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/nonlinear/pen/ogzmre.

 I had a comment on a previous pen (http://codepen.io/willpaige/pen/optzh) that they had used exactly the same technique, but using CSS instead. So I decided to give it a go!

Its a useful animation/style when using a fixed nav which needs more definition further down the page.

Forked from [Will Paige](http://codepen.io/willpaige/)'s Pen [CSS3 on scroll fade in navigation background](http://codepen.io/willpaige/pen/zeqHd/).
