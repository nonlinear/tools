  <h2>Why is Portico using unusual terminology?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>One of Portico's goals with the new audit interface was to be more transparent.  One way to be more transparent was to have the audit interface be a true window into the Portico archive, including the use of Portico internal terminology.  We welcome <a class="brand window" 
target="_blank" href="http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/about-us/contact-us/">your feedback</a> on whether we should continue to use this terminology that matches the Portico content model, or instead use terminology that may be more familiar to our library and publisher auditors.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What is a content type?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>The Portico archive is sliced into a limited set of content types.  These content types allow us to group like content together and make it easier to manage both the content in the archive and the file system storage supporting the archive.  As of December 2010, the content types within the Portico archive are:</p>
  <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 class="scoreboard">
    <tr>
      <td rowspan=2>Content Type</td>
      <td rowspan=2>Description</td>
      <td colspan=2>Available in the Audit Interface</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Metadata</td>
      <td>Files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Business Artifacts</td>
      <td>Portico's license agreements with the publisher participants.  Portico's archive is boot-strappable and self-describing, such that another organization could take the entirety of the archive and quickly begin working with the contents.  To meet this requirement, the archive must contain the publisher agreements which allow Portico to archive the content.</td>

  <h2>What are the <em>supplied</em> categories?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>Portico transforms the publishers' original source files in two ways.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The original XML file is transformed to the NLM archival format, and</li>
    <li> the original packaging is transformed to an archival format.  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>As a backup, however, Portico preserves the original content exactly as it was provided by the publishers in the <em>supplied files</em> content types.</p>
</section>

  <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

  <h2>What is a provider?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>The provider (sometimes referred to as publisher), is the entity with which Portico has a signed license agreement allowing Portico to preserve content.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>Why is Portico a provider?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>Every item preserved in the archive must be associated with a provider.  The license agreements and Portico documentation are associated with the Portico provider.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>Why is Public Domain a provider?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>Every item preserved in the archive much be associated with a provider.  There are items such as openly available standards preserved in the archive and these are associated with the public domain provider.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What is the difference between providers and publishers?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>In general, there is no difference.  Provider is a nuanced term, however, as it is not unusual for any given item to have multiple entities that claim to be the publisher (e.g., a journal published by a society through another publisher) and thus we have used the term provider.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What is this ingested date?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>The date on which that article, book, or other preserved item was ingested into the Portico archive.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What is the Archival ID?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>Portico assigns unique IDs to individual preserved items, the files contained within those items, and even to elements of preservation metadata about the preserved items.  Each of these unique identifiers is an archival identifier (ID).</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What are all those identifiers about?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>Providers often include multiple identifiers with each preserved item and Portico also assigns unique identifiers.  Within the original XML file and the Portico archival, bibliographic metadata (or full-text) XML file, these identifiers are strongly typed.  However, the Portico preservation metadata is used to drive the audit interface and within the preservation metadata is a simple Dublin Core metadata record which includes each and every identifier for the item.  As one goal of the audit interface was to be more transparent, Portico is listing all these identifiers.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What is <em>Metadata Storage Info</em>?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>This is information about the preservation metadata file that Portico creates for every preserved item.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What is <em>Content Unit Info</em></h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>Preserved items may have multiple versions (for example, perhaps the publisher provided Portico with a version of an e-journal article and then a year later provided an updated version).  Each version is a different content unit and has a series of events associated with it.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What is a content unit?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>Preserved items may have multiple versions (for example, perhaps the publisher provided Portico with a version of an e-journal article and then a year later provided an updated version).  Each version is a different content unit and has a series of events associated with it.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What are <em>Events</em>?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>Events are actions that Portico has taken on preserved items.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What is the different between a <em>Unit Event</em> and a <em>Content Unit Event</em>?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>Events can occur on different elements of the preserved item.  Conceptually, each preserved item is a single archival unit.  That archival unit contains one or more content units. <em>Unit Events</em> are those events which are taken on the archival unit as a whole, whereas <em>Content Unit Events</em> are those events which Portico has taken on a specific content unit (version) of the preserved item.</p>
</section>
<nav>
  <h2>What is a D-Collection?</h2>
</nav>
<section>
  <p>As of December 2011, Portico provides libraries and publishers with three distinct preservation services: e-journals, e-books, and d-collections.  A D-Collection contains content preserved via the d-collection preservation service.  It is often (but not always) a digitized historical collection.</p>
