<p>
  FreshDirect is committed to providing a safe and productive, drug-free workplace for its employees, customers, and the general public.  The use of illegal drugs or the abuse of prescription drugs and/or alcohol undermines individual job performance; the security of other employees, customers, and the general public; and the Company's reputation.  Abuse of substances, legal or illegal, affects an individual's ability to perform day to day tasks resulting in an increase in the risk of on duty accidents.  Substance abuse has been shown to have a direct affect on productivity, absenteeism, and tardiness.</p>
<p>While the Company recognizes that chemical dependency and other related medical/ behavioral conditions are treatable conditions, the decision to seek diagnosis and accept medical assistance for substance abuse is the sole responsibility of the employee.  The Company will assist employees who acknowledge that they have a substance abuse problem by providing education, training, counseling, and referral for medical assistance where appropriate.  These services, however, are not the financial responsibility of the Company.  Continued employment is based on the employee's job performance and is not guaranteed by participation in a treatment or rehabilitation program.</p>
<hr /><h3>II.	PROGRAM OBJECTIVES</h3>
<ul>
  <li> A.	To provide employees with proper training as to the potential personal, moral, and economic hazards associated with substance abuse.</li>
  <li>B.	To provide employees with access to counseling and/or rehabilitation programs where appropriate.</li>
  <li>C.	To detect illegal and unauthorized substance abuse in the workplace.</li>
  <li> D.	To reduce the opportunities for accidental injuries to individuals and to protect the property of the Company's employees, contract laborers, and the general public and prevent the occurrence of incidents, the consequences of which may drastically affect the Company's operations.</li>
  <li> E.	To improve productivity and quality, minimize the costs associated with absenteeism and tardiness, and protect the Company's reputation within the community and the industry.</li>
  <li> F.	To comply with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations including but not limited to the Americans with Disabilities Act and regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.</li>
</ul>
<hr /><h3>III.	DEFINITIONS</h3>
<ul>
  <li> A.	&quot;Company Premises&quot; refers to all Company premises, properties, work locations, work areas, offices, facilities, buildings, structures, fixtures, installations, automobiles, trucks, and all vehicles and equipment, whether owned, leased, or used. This policy also covers any area under the Company's control, or any other area visited by a Covered Employee during working time and while in the course and scope of employment.</li>
  <li> B.	&quot;Covered Employee&quot; includes all regular full-time, regular part-time, limited</li>
  <li> hour, Introductory, or contract laborers and applicants for employment with the Company.  The Company requires compliance with this policy as a condition of employment (post offer) for qualified applicants as well as for continued employment by current employees.</li>
  <li> C.	&quot;Illegal Drugs&quot; means any drug that is not legally obtainable.</li>
  <li> D.	&quot;Designer and Synthetic Drugs&quot; means any substances where the molecular structure of both legal and illegal drugs is altered to create a substance that is not explicitly banned by federal law.</li>
  <li> E.	&quot;Prescription Drug Abuse&quot; includes, but is not limited to, use of a prescription drug by someone other than for whom it was prescribed, or use of a prescription drug in a manner inconsistent with the prescription.</li>
  <li> F.	&quot;Trafficking&quot; means to purchase, sell, transfer, or distribute drugs.</li>
  <li> G.	&quot;Unauthorized Use of Alcohol&quot; means having a blood alcohol level (BAC) at or above 0.02% while on Company premises or conducting Company business.</li>
</ul>
<hr /><h3>IV.	POLICY</h3>
<p>
  This will serve to notify each of the Company's Covered Employees that the use, abuse, presence in the body, or reporting to work under the influence, possession or trafficking of illegal or unauthorized drugs, alcoholic beverages, controlled substances or designer and synthetic drugs is strictly prohibited.  Specifically prohibited substances and the applicable testing cutoff and confirmation levels will be outlined in the Procedures section of this document.</p>
<p> Covered Employees may maintain on Company Premises prescription drugs provided the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The prescription drugs are prescribed by an authorized physician for current use (within the past 12 months) by the person in possession and the medication is in the original container in that Covered Employee's name.</li>
  <li>Covered Employees must use the medication in the manner for which it 		was prescribed.</li>
  <li> Any Covered Employee who has been informed that the medication which he/she has been prescribed may cause side effects must inform his/her supervisor of those side effects prior to reporting to work using such medication.  Covered Employees, while taking such medication, may be asked to perform substitute work duties which are deemed at low risk.  However, if such transfer of work duties is not available, the Company may have to limit or suspend the work (through the use of accrued leave, etc.) of the employee during the period of time that the employee is taking the medication in question. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Company will assist individuals who come forward and acknowledge that they have a substance abuse problem; however, violation of any of the policy conditions set forth herein will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.</p>
<hr /><h3>V.	PROCEDURES</h3>
<p>
  Employees are responsible for their job performance, behavior, and conduct while at work.  Employees will be counseled or disciplined, as appropriate, regardless of their acknowledgement of the existence of a substance abuse problem or current use of drugs.  The Company reserves the right, in certain circumstances, to require employees to submit to drug and/or alcohol tests at any time as a condition of employment or continued employment.  This testing will be performed under the following conditions:</p>
<p> A.	PRE-EMPLOYMENT TESTING:  Any manager or employee entrusted with hiring capabilities will have the initial responsibility of advising all prospective employees that the Company conducts drug abuse screening in order to maintain a safe and productive workplace. All applicants will sign a drug testing release and consent form, along with policy acknowledgement.  Oral offers of employment – and offers of promotion to certain positions – will be made contingent on successfully passing the drug abuse screen.  Applicable written offers of employment will state that employment is contingent upon successfully passing the drug abuse screen.</p>
<p>If the applicant fails the drug abuse screen, then the designated representative will inform the applicant that employment is denied on that basis.  Procedures for communicating the results of drug screens are outlined in paragraph F of this section.</p>
<p>B.	POST-ACCIDENT TESTING:  Any Covered Employee who is involved in a serious or potentially serious accident or incident in which (i) safety precautions were violated, (ii) unsafe instructions or orders were given, (iii) equipment or property was damaged or an individual was injured, (iv) unusually careless acts were performed, or (v) the cause was due to an employee or other person's failure to wear prescribed personal protective equipment or follow prescribed safety rules while working on Company Premises, in a Company vehicle, or on the property of a customer, will require a drug abuse screen.</p>
<p>If the Covered Employee fails or refuses to take the drug screen, he/she will be subject to discipline up to and including discharge.</p>
<p>If alcohol is suspected in relation to the accident in question, a breath/alcohol test will also be conducted in conjunction with the drug abuse screen.</p><p>
  C.	RETURN TO DUTY TESTING:  Employees returning from a drug or alcohol-related leave of absence must successfully complete a drug and/or alcohol screen before being allowed to return to work.</p>
<p>After returning to work, these Covered Employees will be subjected to unannounced testing, as prescribed by Company management, for up to (2) years.  If the employee refuses to submit to such testing, he/she will be subject to discipline up to and including discharge.</p>
<p> D.	REASONABLE SUSPICION TESTING:  Any Covered Employee, regardless of position, may be asked to submit to a drug or alcohol screen if the Company has reason to believe that the employee in question is under the influence.   Such reasonable suspicion by the Company includes, but is not limited to, erratic behavior, smelling of alcohol or marijuana, and credible allegations of drug use or intoxication. </p>
<p> E.	TRAFFICKING AND RELATED MISCONDUCT:  Employees who observe trafficking and related misconduct are encouraged to report these incidents to their immediate supervisor.</p>
<p> F.	COMMUNICATING DRUG/ALCOHOL TEST RESULTS:  Applicants who do not successfully pass the drug screen will be informed by the appropriate Company official that employment is denied on that basis.  All applicants/employees will be advised that they have (5) business days from the date of written notification to challenge or explain the validity of the test results, and they may do so if they have additional information for management to consider, e.g., information omitted at the time of testing regarding review of prescription drugs, etc.  It is within the sole discretion of Company management, in conjunction with the Medical Review Officer (“MRO”), to determine whether or not the information provided alters the validity of the test results or justifies retesting the same or an additional urine sample.</p>
<p>All information regarding drug test results will be treated as confidential.  The hiring manager or supervisor will be informed by a designated Company official that the applicant was not approved, without specific reference to the drug screen results.  If the applicant chooses to disclose the test results to the hiring manager or supervisor, the information will be treated as confidential.  Discussions of the urine drug and/or blood alcohol screen results is inappropriate and could result in disciplinary action should a violation occur.</p>
<hr /><h3>VI.	EMPLOYEE EDUCATION AND TRAINING</h3>
<p>
  A copy of the Substance Abuse Policy will be available for all applicants to review at the time of hire.  Applicants and employees may receive a copy of the policy from the Company's Human Resources Department.</p>
<p>The following information will be provided to employees during new hire orientation:</p>
<ul>
  <li> A.	The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace.</li>
  <li> B.	How to obtain available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and assistance. </li>
</ul>
<hr /><h3>VII.	SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND TESTING PROCEDURES</h3>
<p>
  Specimen collection will be performed by an outside agency (occupational medical facility or laboratory operated collection site) specifically trained for compliance with NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) guidelines or through an internal process approved by NIDA.  Specimens will be shipped to a DHHS (Department of Health and Human Services) certified laboratory for testing.  Urine or saliva  specimens will be initially tested utilizing the EMIT (Enzyme Multiple Immunoassay Technique) screen, and any presumptive positive specimen will be confirmed by the GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry) method, the most respected combination available in the industry.  Additionally, any required breath specimen for the detection of the presence of alcohol will be tested utilizing the breath alcohol testing methodology.</p>
<p>The Company will utilize the services of an MRO for the interpretation of confirmed positive results.  An MRO is a licensed physician with specific knowledge of substance abuse disorders, having the specific training necessary to evaluate an individual's positive test result relative to the individual's medical history and any other relevant biomedical factors.</p>
<hr /><h3>VIII.	EMPLOYEE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
<p>
  Employees will always have the opportunity to present an alternative explanation as to the reason for a positive test result.  It is, however, the responsibility of each employee to seek help before drug and/or alcohol-related problems lead to disciplinary action up to and including discharge of employment.  Once a violation of this policy has occurred, seeking rehabilitative or counseling assistance will not necessarily lessen disciplinary action and may, in fact, have no bearing on the determination of appropriate disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Once an employee's employment has been terminated due to the violation of this policy, the employee may re-apply for employment with the Company after thirty (30) days following the employee’s termination date.  Written certification documenting the successful completion of a drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation program signed by the appropriate counselor/specialist will be required prior to the acceptance of any re-application.  Upon such re-application, the former employee will be regarded as a new applicant, with the Company being under no obligation to automatically extend a second offer of employment.</p>
<p>A former employee terminated for violation of this policy who has been tendered a second offer of employment under this section will be subject to the &quot;Return to Duty&quot; testing as outlined in this policy.  Any subsequent violation of this policy by an employee previously terminated under this section will disqualify said employee from any future rehire eligibility.</p>
