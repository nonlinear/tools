<p>The Company respects the privacy of its employees.  At the same time, the Company has a need to monitor, tape, and disclose employees’ electronic communications, which include but are not limited to telephone and e-mail conversations, in order to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>protect Company proprietary information and other Company property</li>
  <li> promote efficiency and proper service to customers</li>
  <li> prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing</li>
  <li> comply with legal or regulatory requests for information </li>
  <li> assure that the Company’s electronic systems are not being used contrary to this policy</li>
</ul>
<hr /><h3>Telephone, Voicemail, Computer, Electronic Mail And Internet Usage Policy </h3>
<p>FreshDirect provides telephone, voicemail, computers, e-mail, and the Internet (“Electronic Services”) to certain employees in order to make their jobs easier and to better serve our clients and customers.  These Electronic Services are intended for business use.  Employees should have no expectation of privacy with respect to using the Electronic Services.  The use of the Company’s Electronic Services constitutes an employee’s consent to all of the terms set forth herein. </p><p>
  Employees are prohibited from engaging in inappropriate conduct when using the Company’s Internet and e-mail.  Specific inappropriate conduct includes, but is not limited to, the following: (1) use of the Internet for unlawful activities, (2) use of the Internet for commercial activities not related to the Company, (3) any violation of the Company’s or any other organization’s computer system security, (4) any communication which violates applicable laws and regulations, (5) any violation of any copyright laws, (6) use of abusive or otherwise objectionable language in either public or private messages, (7) the sending of messages that are likely to result in the loss of </p><p>
  work or systems, (8) the sending of “chain letters&quot; or “broadcast” messages to lists or individuals, and other messages which cause congestion of the networks or otherwise interfere with the work of others, (9) accessing unapproved, non-business related websites, (10) using the systems to harass, sexually or otherwise; (11) operating another business via the Internet or e-mail; or (12) excessive personal use. </p>
<p>Employees must adhere to a standard of confidentiality, and may not communicate confidential Company or customer information over the Internet. </p>
<p>Employees may only download files from the Internet if: (1) it is done for business purposes only, (2) the employer consents to such downloading in writing, and (3) the files are scanned for viruses using a Company-approved anti-virus program.  No software or hardware may be installed, and no software may be copied, without the prior written approval of management. </p>
<p>Employees are prohibited from viewing, downloading, receiving, and sending pornographic images, dirty jokes, cartoons, and other potentially offensive materials on the Company’s computer equipment.  If an employee receives such unsolicited materials, he/she must immediately delete same, and must notify the sender of the Company’s policy. </p>
<p>Employees are prohibited from reading, retrieving, or otherwise obtaining access to other employees’ e-mail or Internet messages without their consent.  Moreover, employees are strictly prohibited from accessing personal e-mail accounts using Company computers and software.</p>
<p>Voicemails, e-mail messages, including personal messages, and all data stored on the Company’s Electronic Services are considered Company property.  E-mail, voicemail, or Internet messages sent or received by Company employees are not confidential.  The Company has no intention of monitoring all voicemail and e-mail messages; however, the Company reserves the right, at any time, to listen to voicemail messages and to review e-mail messages and to monitor Internet access in order to ensure that these systems are being used properly.  The Company reserves the right to monitor these Electronic Services even though the employee may have chosen or have been given a “confidential” password or code number to access voice or e-mail.  The Company keeps a record of all passwords and access numbers provided to employees and may use that information to access either voicemail or e-mail, at its discretion.</p>
<p>Computer systems hardware, as well as the messages composed, sent or received on the e-mail system and voicemail, and all of the Company’s communication systems, are the exclusive property of FreshDirect.  All documents, information and data created, stored, and/or copied to the Company’s computer system are the Company’s property and may not be copied or transmitted in any form to a third party, other than in the ordinary course of business on behalf of the Company. </p>
<p>Misuse of the Electronic Services or failure to follow the Company’s policies will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.</p>
<p>Employees issued laptop computers, printers, and other peripheral equipment are responsible for their care and custody while out of the office.  Employees will be required to replace and/or repair such equipment if damaged or stolen while in their possession.</p>
<hr /><h3>Workplace Monitoring</h3>
<p>Workplace monitoring may be conducted by FreshDirect to ensure quality control, employee safety, security, and customer satisfaction. </p>
<p>Employees who regularly communicate with customers may have their telephone conversations monitored or recorded.  Telephone monitoring is used to identify and correct performance problems through targeted training.  Improved job performance enhances our customers’ image of FreshDirect as well as their satisfaction with our service. </p>
<p>FreshDirect may conduct video surveillance of non-private workplace areas.  Video monitoring is used to identify safety concerns, maintain quality control, detect theft and misconduct, and discourage or prevent acts of harassment and workplace violence. </p>
<p>Because FreshDirect is sensitive to the legitimate privacy rights of employees, every effort will be made to guarantee that workplace monitoring is done in an ethical and respectful manner.</p>
<hr /><h3>Prohibition Against Using Cellular Phones While Driving</h3>
<p>Distracting conversations and other distractions are to be avoided while driving.  While FreshDirect supports the use of cellular telephones for business purposes, we prohibit employees from using cellular phones while driving or operating equipment.  If an employee needs to make or take a business call while operating a vehicle or other piece of equipment, the employee should stop to take the call in a safe location.  In addition, FreshDirect expects that all employees comply with applicable state laws, which vary state by state, regarding the use of cell phones while operating a motor vehicle.</p>
<hr /><h3>Pagers, Cellular Phones &amp; Nextel</h3>
<p>Cell phones are provided to certain employees to assist in communicating with management, other employees, and our clients. They are intended for business calls.  Employees found to be abusing cell phones, Nextels, or other Company-issued telecommunication equipment will be required to pay for their personal use, and may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.  Cell phone users are reminded that proper telephone etiquette is expected on cell phones as well as regular business phones.</p>
<p>Excessive personal use of the telephone, including personal cellular phones, during working time is not permitted.  Personal calls are not permitted except during breaks or lunch periods, and no employee may use a personal cellular phone or make a personal phone call while on the Plant floor.  Employees will be charged for personal calls made from the Company telephone system, except for those made during a time of emergency.  Friends and family should be instructed not to contact employees at work unless in the case of an emergency. </p>
<hr /><h3>Family Emergencies</h3>
<p>In the event FreshDirect receives word of an emergency related to a member of an employee’s family, the Company will notify the employee as soon as possible.  Should the employee be at a location away from his/her usual workplace, arrangements will be made to contact the employee, and if necessary, the Company will arrange for the employee to return home immediately.</p>
