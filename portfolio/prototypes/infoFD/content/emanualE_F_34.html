<p>The FreshDirect Human Resources department ensures that discipline, such as termination and suspension, is consistently administered across the Company.  Nevertheless, an employee who is subjected to discipline sometimes believes that the decision leading to discipline was unfair or otherwise inappropriate.  FreshDirect has created a Discipline Review Board (“DRB”).  The function of the DRB is described in this policy.</p>
<hr /><h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The DRB’s role is to review those disciplinary decisions under its jurisdiction whenever an employee who is subject to such discipline seeks DRB review via the process described herein.</p>
<hr /><h3>Authority</h3>
<p>The DRB has the authority to review terminations and suspensions of hourly employees, and to reverse a disciplinary decision of this type or to reduce the level of discipline in the initial decision (e.g., to reduce a termination to a 2-week suspension or to reduce a 3-day suspension to a disciplinary write-up).  The DRB does not have the authority to increase the level of discipline in any matter that it reviews.  The DRB has no authority over disciplinary actions taken against an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement or over disciplinary actions exempted from DRB review by the Company’s CEO or General Counsel.</p>
<hr /><h3>Makeup</h3>
<p>The DRB will sit as a 5-member panel made up of 2 supervisory employees and 3 non-supervisory employees.  The participants in each 5-member panel will be chosen on a rotating basis from a pool of DRB panelists who will be chosen by the Company’s Human Resources Department.  Those interested in being a DRB panelist can apply to the Human Resources department.  DRB panelists will serve for a term of no more than 2 years, and must remain employees in good standing of FreshDirect to retain their panelist status.</p>
<hr /><h3>Process</h3>
<p>A request for DRB review must be initiated by completing a Discipline Review Request (“DRR”) form, available from the Human Resources department.  An initial DRR form must be submitted to the Human Resources department within 3 calendar days of the employee’s notice of discipline.  Only employees beyond their Introductory Period (first 3 months of employment at FreshDirect) are eligible to use the DRB process.  Once the DRR form is complete, the Human Resources department will schedule a DRB panel meeting within 1 week.  The panel will be chosen on a rotating basis with panelists from the complaining employee’s department or others with personal knowledge or relationships excluded from the list of those eligible.  A panelist who is chosen but feels that he or she cannot, for any reason, serve as an unbiased decision maker must recuse himself or herself and another panelist will be chosen.</p>
<p>The DRB will conduct a hearing in 45 minutes or less.  Each serving panelist will have received the DRR form in advance of the hearing.  A Human Resources department representative will begin with a 10 minute review of the matter, followed by a 10 minute presentation from the employee and a 10 minute presentation from the manager who imposed the discipline.  During these presentations, only the panelists, the particular presenter, and a translator, if required, will be present in the room.  The DRB panel will decide if it wants to hear separately from any identified witnesses whose statements have been provided.</p>
<p>The panelists will then spend the final 15 minutes of the 45 minute session in private discussing the matter and making a decision.  The panel’s decision will be entered on the bottom of the DRR form and placed in the employee’s file and a copy will be provided to the employee.  All proceedings must be held in strictest confidence.</p>
<hr /><h3>Discipline pending appeal</h3>
<p>If an employee is terminated, the employee will not be permitted to return to work unless and until the DRB overturns the termination.  The employee will not be eligible for back pay.  If an employee is suspended and seeks DRB review of the suspension, the suspension will not begin until the final decision is made by the DRB.</p>
