<p>The Company expects that its employees, in the conduct of its business, will follow the practices and principles set forth in this code and comply with all applicable laws wherever the Company operates.  The purpose of this code is to reaffirm the principles and guidelines with respect to business conduct, which the Company expects its employees to observe.  It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of “rights and wrongs.”</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of each employee to read this code, to understand it, and in <br />
  day-to-day activities to assess actions to be taken to ensure that they are consistent with the intention of this code.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the information in or the application of this code to a particular situation should be reviewed with Human Resources.</p>
<p>Supervisors must strive to be fully aware of the practices and procedures being followed by subordinate employees and take steps to ensure that employees measure up to expected standards of behavior as they carry out their duties.</p>
<p>Any employee having knowledge of any violation or suspected violation of this code shall promptly report such matter in writing to Human Resources.</p>
<p>FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS CODE MAY RESULT IN DISMISSAL OR OTHER DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, LEGAL ACTION.</p>

<hr /><h3>Legal Compliance</h3>
<p>You must transact company business in accordance with the national, state and local laws of every jurisdiction in which the Company’s business is conducted.</p>
<p>Because of the complexities, ambiguities, and rapid changes in content and interpretation of the various laws and regulations which may be applicable to places where the Company operates, it is not possible to provide detailed directions for employees to follow in the course of their daily operations.  In general, however, you are not permitted to use Company funds or assets directly or indirectly for political contributions, including to a political party, committee organization, candidate or government official.  Gifts of substantial value to, or extravagant entertainment of, government officials is also prohibited.  These actions could be construed as an attempt to secure sales or obtain favorable treatment and compromise the official’s integrity and adversely reflect on the business ethics of the Company. </p>
<p>In all questionable areas you should seek guidance and advice from the Company’s General Counsel. </p>

<hr /><h3>Gifts</h3>
<p>Bribes, kickbacks, and other illegal payments to or from any individual with whom the Company conducts business of any kind are prohibited.  No employee may accept a gift of any value greater than $20 from any Company vendor. </p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about the appropriateness of such gift, entertainment or expenses, discuss them with your supervisor.</p>

<hr /><h3>
Business and Financial Records</h3>
<p>Maintain Company business and financial records honestly and accurately.</p>
<p>Company business and financial records and documents must be honestly and accurately maintained and, in the case of financial records, conform to generally accepted accounting principles.  Entries on books, records, or documents for which you are responsible must accurately reflect transactions.</p>
<p>Payments made by or on behalf of the Company must be for the purpose described in company books and records. </p>
<p>No undisclosed or unrecorded corporate funds or assets shall be established for any purpose. </p>

<hr /><h3>
Company Property</h3>
<p>Company property is to be used exclusively for conducting Company business and must not be used for personal reasons.</p>
<p>Company property, such as office supplies, products, and reference books may not be removed from company facilities unless they are necessary for you to perform your job. You must return the property when it is no longer needed for business purposes.</p>
<p>It is your personal responsibility to safeguard Company property, records, and funds against loss, damage, misuse, or theft.  You must adhere to the company procedures for disbursing, receiving, returning and reporting their use.</p>

<hr /><h3>
Outside Employment or Business Relationships</h3>
<p>You are expected to devote your maximum ability to Company interests.</p>
<p>Employment outside the Company is permissible subject to any contractual agreement to the contrary.  Other employment may not interfere with your job performance at the Company, including the availability for travel.</p>
<p>You may not perform work for, or affiliate yourself with, a competitor or an organization doing or seeking to do business with the Company.</p>
<p>You may not perform work for an organization, or perform work in your own name, where the performance of said work would reflect on the integrity of the Company, or your integrity in the performance of your duties for the Company. </p>
<hr /><h3>
Participation in Civic and Political Activities</h3>
<p>Do not represent the Company when carrying out public duties and avoid any conflict of interest.</p>
<p>If you participate in community affairs, including political and civic activities, you must represent yourself as an individual citizen and you must not represent the Company in any way when participating in such activities.  The Company will ensure that it takes no action with respect to your participation in such activities that may be construed as an attempt to influence you in the exercise of your duties. </p>

<hr /><h3>
Confidential Information</h3>
<p>Do not use confidential information for personal profit or gain.</p>
<p>Company confidential information belongs to the Company. All information concerning Company securities, financial condition, earnings, or activities, such as acquisitions, divestitures, new products, or processes, must remain confidential until property disclosed to the public.  You may not use this information for your personal gain or the gain of family or friends. </p>

<hr /><h3>
Speculation in Company Securities and In Real Estate</h3>
<p>Do not use confidential information obtained from or through the Company to speculate in Company securities or in real estate.</p>
<p>Employees may not use Company confidential information in connection with the purchase or sale of Company securities for their gain or the gain of others.</p>
<p>Employees are prohibited from the ownership or acquisition or real property or interests in real property the value of which has been, or is likely to be, materially affected by any action of the Company or influenced by any decision or recommendation of the employee owning such property.</p>

<hr /><h3>
Advertising</h3>
<p>Honestly and fairly stress the value and capabilities of Company products.</p>
<p>Do not use tactics that unfairly undermine the products of a competitor either in advertisements, demonstrations, comments or innuendo.</p>

<hr /><h3>
Conflicts of Interest</h3>
<p>Avoid any situation which could create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest with your responsibilities at the Company.</p>
<p>A conflict of interest occurs when personal consideration or relationships take precedence over the best interests of the Company or influence the objective decisions required by the performance of your responsibilities for the Company.</p>
<p>Unless authorized in writing by Human Resources to act after full disclosure, you must not act on behalf of the Company in any business dealings with a concern in which you have a material financial interest, a significant indebtedness, a personal contract, relationship or understanding or employs a family member.  Contact the Company’s General Counsel if you are uncertain about the application of this prohibition.</p>
<p>Advance approval from management is required before you may accept or solicit a gift of any kind from a customer, supplier or vendor representative.</p>
<p>You and your family members may not receive money, gifts, loans, preferred investment opportunities, special price concessions, discounts, special terms, or free services from any person or entity that does or wants to do business with the Company or is a competitor of the Company.  You also may not accept unusual or extended hospitality in any form including entertainment at a resort or similar accommodation, or payment of personal or non-related business expenses, from any organization or individual who has, or seeks to have, a business relationship with the Company or is a competitor of the Company.  Such offers of any of the foregoing must be reported to your supervisor.</p>
<p>Gifts of token value from non-competitors of the Company are the only exception to the above-mentioned prohibition.  These are items of a keepsake, remembrance, or commemorative nature and would be of a reasonable and nominal value.  Examples of acceptable gifts include pocket diaries, calendars, occasional tickets to sporting or cultural events and inexpensive writing utensils.  If you are offered or receive a gift above a token, offers of free travel or services, etc., you should report it to your supervisor and return it to the donor.  An appropriate letter should be sent to the donor explaining the Company’s policy on gifts with a copy of this code attached to the letter.</p>
<p>Your entertainment of a representative of an organization doing or seeking to do business with the Company, or your being the beneficiary of entertainment from such sources should constitute an event that can be categorized as exceptional, appropriate, and subject to reciprocity.  The event should be of an infrequent nature, consist of a luncheon or dinner or sports or cultural event which takes place at a setting that is appropriate but not extravagant.  Although the acceptance of such entertainment on occasion is a normal and permissible business practice, care must be exercised to ensure that it is necessary and that the value and frequency are not excessive.  If practical, you should pay your share of the cost or, alternately, adhere to a rule of reciprocity.  In those cases where sharing the cost or reciprocation is not possible, but you believe it is in the Company’s interest to attend, you should get the agreement of your supervisor.</p>
<p>If you are invited by a supplier or by any organization or individual who does or seeks to do business with the Company to attend an event which might be incorrectly perceived, you should discuss the matter, prior to accepting, with your supervisor.  If participation in the event count be viewed as compromising your objectivity, or as placing the supplier or other entity in a favored position, the invitation should be appropriately declined.  When in doubt always discuss the matter with your supervisor.</p>
<p>You may not purchase at discount through Company vendors or purchase through the Company’s credit or accounts. </p>
