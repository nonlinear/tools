<h3>Group Insurance</h3>
<p>FreshDirect is dedicated to the health and well being of both you and your family.  A comprehensive, quality medical care insurance program is available to you and your family.  You, your spouse, and your dependents become eligible for coverage six (6) months following your date of hire.  Upon enrolling, you will obtain summary plan descriptions describing your benefits in detail.  FreshDirect contributes substantially towards the cost of such coverage.  Consult the Manager of Human Resources for further information regarding those costs and other administrative details. </p>
<p>The costs of medical care coverage and the benefits available under the plan may be increased (or decreased) from time to time by the insurance company underwriting the plan, and the Company reserves the right to change health insurance carriers and plans.  As health care costs continue to rise, the Company will attempt to provide suitable health coverage to its employees.  However, when necessary, the Company reserves the right to change the portion and amount paid by employees for health insurance premiums.</p>
<p>According to the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985, in the event of your termination of employment with FreshDirect or loss of eligibility to remain covered under our group health insurance program, you and your eligible dependents may have the right to continued coverage under our health insurance program for a limited period of time at your own expense under COBRA.  Consult Human Resources for details.</p>

<h3>Disability Insurance</h3>
<p>The New York State Disability Insurance Plan is designed to assist employees working in New York State with their income, should a partial or total disability occur and an employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his/her job, in accordance with New York State Disability Law and the provisions of FreshDirect’s Sick Leave Policy.</p>
<p>Regular full-time employees working in New York State who have been on FreshDirect’s payroll who are continuously disabled for more than seven (7) calendar days due to illness or injury that is not work-related may be eligible for benefits under the New York State Disability Insurance Plan.  The Plan provides a weekly benefit payment equal to 50% of base salary (excluding overtime pay, bonuses, or extra compensation) up to a maximum weekly benefit.</p>
<p>Employees who expect to be continuously disabled and unable to work for more than seven (7) calendar days should notify the Human Resources Department as soon as possible after the start of illness or injury so that claims can be processed promptly.
