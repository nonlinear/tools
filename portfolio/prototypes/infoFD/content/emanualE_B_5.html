<p>FreshDirect is committed to maintaining a workplace free from harassment (sexual or otherwise) and intimidation of any employee or job applicant, male or female.  FreshDirect does not accept, condone, or tolerate actions of harassment by any employee, client, vendor or any individual on the basis of any personal characteristic, including, but not limited to race, color, citizenship status, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, creed, physical or mental disability, marital status, alienage, citizenship status, partnership status, veteran status, ancestry, political affiliation, genetic predisposition or carrier status, or any other factor protected by federal, state, or local laws. </p>
<h2>What is Harassment?</h2>
<p>Harassment usually involves behavior that is personally offensive, fails to respect the rights of others, lowers morale, and, therefore, interferes with our work effectiveness.  Harassment may take different forms and may involve, but is not limited to, pictures, jokes, cartoons, posters, suggestive remarks or comments, gestures, sexual demands, pranks, intimidation, e-mails or other interoffice communications displaying inappropriate materials, propositions, unwanted physical contact, or violence.  Harassment is not necessarily sexual in nature.  It may also take the form of other vocal activity including derogatory statements not directed to the targeted individual but taking place within their hearing.  Whatever form it takes, harassment is insulting and demeaning to the recipient and will not be tolerated in the workplace.</p>
<p>One type of harassment is sexual harassment.  Sexual harassment is unwelcome, unsolicited conduct of a sexual nature or because of one’s sex, which an employee regards as undesirable or offensive.  It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other conduct of physical, verbal or non-verbal nature where: </p>
<p>Submission to such conduct is either an explicit or implicit condition or term of employment<br />
  Submission to and/or rejection of such conduct impacts upon or is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the individual in question<br />
  Such conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance or<br />
  Such conduct has the effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment</p>
<h2>Responsibility</h2>
<p>All FreshDirect employees, and particularly managers and supervisors, have a responsibility for keeping our work environment free of harassment.  Any employee, who becomes aware of an incident of harassment, whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, must report it to either Human Resources by going to the Human Resources Department or to any management representative with whom they feel comfortable.  When management becomes aware of the existence of harassment, it will take prompt and effective remedial action.</p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>While you may decide to communicate directly with the alleged harasser, and to make it clear to the harasser that his or her behavior is unacceptable, offensive or inappropriate, it is not required that you do so.  It is essential, however, that any employee who believes he or she has been the subject of harassment should report the alleged act immediately (preferably as soon as possible after the alleged harassment occurs) to Human Resources (both male and female representatives are available) by visiting Human Resources or calling 1-866-568-5429. You must report the alleged act immediately even if you are not sure the offending behavior is considered harassment.  Under no circumstances need an employee report the harassment to a person whom he or she is accusing of inappropriate behavior or with whom he or she feels uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Any such complaint reported to management or Human Resources will be promptly and fully investigated, and appropriate action taken.  All information will be kept confidential except insofar as it must be disclosed in order to investigate and resolve the matter.  If the investigation establishes that harassment has occurred, the offending employee will be appropriately disciplined, up to and including termination.</p>
<p>The Company also recognizes that false accusations of sexual harassment (as well as the other previously listed forms of discrimination) can have a serious impact on innocent women and men.  If an employee makes a false accusation of harassment or discrimination, he/she will be disciplined, up to and including termination of employment.</p>
<p>This policy prohibits retaliation against employees who bring harassment charges or assist in investigating charges.  Any employee bringing a good faith harassment complaint or assisting in the investigation of such a complaint will not be adversely affected in terms and conditions of employment, nor discriminated against or terminated because of the complaint. </p>
