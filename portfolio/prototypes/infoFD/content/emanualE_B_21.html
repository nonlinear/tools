<h3>Business Hours</h3>
<p>As FreshDirect business demands dictate, our regular operating hours may extend to twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  FreshDirect will arrange work schedules to be flexible to meet such demands.</p>
<p>Your particular hours of work and the scheduling of meal periods, to which you are entitled, will be determined and assigned by your immediate supervisor.  Please note that, as you were informed during the interview process, the Company may require hourly employees to work overtime.  While volunteers often can handle the excess work required, certain roles and, for all roles, certain times of year may necessitate overtime work.  All work schedules must comply with applicable law regarding wages and hours.  Should you have any questions concerning your work schedule, please ask your immediate supervisor.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>FreshDirect expects you to be ready to work at the beginning of your assigned daily work hours, and to reasonably complete your projects by the end of your assigned work hours.  You must let your immediate supervisor know if you will be away from your work station (other than for authorized breaks and meal periods to which you are entitled) for any period of time and when you expect to return.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Absence or Lateness</h3>
<p>From time to time, it may be necessary for you to be absent from work. FreshDirect is aware that emergencies, illnesses, or pressing personal business that cannot be scheduled outside your work hours may arise.  Paid Time Off (PTO) hours have been provided for this purpose.</p>
<p>If you are unable to report to work when scheduled, or if you will arrive late for work, you must contact your immediate supervisor or your manager as soon as possible, but no later than 2 hours before the time you were scheduled to begin work.  Failure to make such contact may result in appropriate disciplinary action against you.  If you know in advance that you will need to be absent, please request this time off directly from your immediate supervisor, who will grant such request in his/her sole discretion.</p>
<p>If you are unable to call in yourself because of an illness, emergency or for some other reason, you must arrange to have someone call for you.</p>
<p>Absence from work for three (3) consecutive scheduled work days without notifying your immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department will be considered job abandonment â€“ a voluntary resignation on your part.</p>
<p>If you are absent because of an illness for three (3) or more consecutive days, you must submit written documentation from your doctor stating why you were absent and when you are able to resume normal work duties before you will be allowed to return to work. If you are absent for a week or more because of an illness or injury, you could be eligible for the state-mandated disability program.</p>
<p>Note that excessive absences from work or patterned absences (e.g., absences occurring just before or after scheduled days off or absence on a day when PTO was requested but could not be accommodated) may result in appropriate disciplinary action against you.  Your immediate supervisor or Human Resources will make a note of any absences or latenesses, and their reasons, in your personnel file.</p>
<p>Please see your department or work area for its specific attendance and lateness policy and associated progressive discipline guidelines.</p>	
<hr />
<h3>Telecommuting</h3>
<p>FreshDirect does not generally permit telecommuting.  If you are scheduled to work at FreshDirect and cannot reach the office for any reason, you must follow the procedures in this manual for calling out.  Assuming you have accrued PTO, you will be paid for the day and charged a PTO day.  If you are out of the office on Company business or if your supervisor directs you to work from home, you will not be charged for a PTO day.</p>
<p>In certain cases, the Company may consider a formal arrangement of 1 or 2 days per week of telecommuting for a full time employee.  In all such cases, approval of telecommuting will be at the Company's sole discretion and will not be given to any role where telecommuting is impractical.  A manager seeking approval for an employee's telecommuting arrangement must confirm:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The employee's role is appropriate for telecommuting 1 or 2 days per week</li>
<li>The employee is independent and reliable and will likely be a productive telecommuter</li>
<li>The manager will take responsibility for ensuring that the employee is productive and will terminate the telecommuting arrangement if it is not working for any reason</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The manager of a telecommuting employee must submit confirmation of the factors above in an initial request form and a quarterly follow-up certification during the entire course of a telecommuting arrangement.</p>
