<p>FreshDirect recognizes that, from time to time, employees may require a leave of absence to attend to certain family or medical situations, including those related to military situations.  Therefore, and in compliance with applicable federal and state laws, FreshDirect will provide leave to eligible employees requiring time off for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To care for their newborn child or for the adoption or foster placement of a child (within 12 months of the birth, adoption, or placement) (referred to as &quot;family leave&quot;)</li>
  <li>To provide necessary care for the serious health condition of their spouse, parent, or minor or disabled child (referred to as &quot;family leave&quot;)</li>
  <li>For their own serious health condition, including pregnancy and on-the-job illnesses or injuries, which makes them unable to perform the essential functions of their job (referred to as &quot;medical leave&quot;)</li>
  <li>A qualifying exigency arising out of their spouse, child, or parent’s service on active duty in the Armed Forces or call to active duty in the Armed Forces in support of a contingency plan (referred to as “qualifying exigency leave”)</li>
  <li>To care for their spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (nearest blood relative) who is a covered servicemember and who has incurred an injury or illness in the line of duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render him or her medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her office, grade, rank, or rating (a covered servicemember is a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness); this type of leave is referred to as “servicemember leave”</li>
</ul>
<hr /><h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>Employees who have been employed at FreshDirect for at least 12 months and have actually worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding their leave are eligible to receive up to 12 weeks of family/medical leave in a 12-month period (measured from the date an employee's first family/medical leave begins).   Employees with disabilities who do not meet the above eligibility requirements may be granted medical leave in the discretion of FreshDirect.  Spouses employed by FreshDirect are jointly entitled to a combined total of 12 weeks of family leave for the birth and care of the newborn child, for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for a parent who has a serious health condition. </p>
<p>Eligible employees may take up to 12 workweeks of qualifying exigency leave during any 12-month period.  Qualifying exigency leave is limited to 12 workweeks and runs concurrently with other types of FMLA leave.  Eligible employees may take up to 26 workweeks of servicemember leave during a single 12-month period to care for the servicemember.  Servicemember leave runs concurrent with other FMLA leave and other leave entitlements provided under federal, state, and local law.  Servicemember leave, when combined with other FMLA-qualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks in a single 12-month period.  As with family and medical leave, employees are eligible for qualifying exigency leave and servicemember leave if they work at a covered location, have been employed at the Company for at least 12 months, and have actually worked at least 1,250 hours during the preceding 12-month period. </p>
<p>Any leaves under state law will run concurrently with the federal leave as applicable.  Since, in some states, employees may be entitled to additional leave, benefits and rights, employees considering family/medical leave should contact Human Resources for further information and consult the state supplements to this Handbook.</p>
<hr /><h3>Form of Leave</h3>
<p>Family leave, medical leave, and qualifying exigency leave may be taken in one consecutive period of up to 12 weeks, and servicemember leave for periods of up to 26 weeks. When medically necessary, employees may take family leave, medical leave, and servicemember leave intermittently (in separate blocks of time), or on a reduced leave schedule (fewer hours in a day or days in a week). Qualifying exigency leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule where the employee provides appropriate notice and certification.  Intermittent or reduced schedule leave to care for a newborn or newly adopted or foster-placed child may only be taken if granted in the discretion of FreshDirect.  Employees must attempt to schedule medical treatment or other bases for intermittent or reduced schedule leave so as not to disrupt FreshDirect’s operations.  Employees who wish to take intermittent or reduced schedule leave may, at FreshDirect’s discretion and unless prohibited by law, be transferred to a position for which they are qualified and for which they will receive equivalent pay and benefits, which may better accommodate such leave.</p>
<hr /><h3>Notice and Required Forms</h3>
<p>Employees seeking family leave, medical leave, and servicemember leave, to the extent that such leave is foreseeable and not inconsistent with state law, must provide at least 30 days notice to Human Resources prior to the requested leave. In emergency circumstances, employees must provide notice to Human Resources as soon as practicable.  Employees seeking qualified exigency leave must provide as much notice prior to the leave as is reasonable and practical where the leave is foreseeable.  Failure to provide proper notice may result in a delay of leave.  Upon requesting family leave, medical leave, or servicemember leave, Human Resources will issue the appropriate leave paperwork including a Certification of Health Care Provider form, which must be completed and returned to Human Resources within 15 days.  Employees requesting qualifying exigency leave must provide a certification as described by the Department of Labor when such regulations are created.  Human Resources will be solely responsible for granting or denying a request for family/medical leave.</p>
<hr /><h3>Use of Paid Time</h3>
<p>All leaves of absence under this policy are without pay.  However, employees must exhaust accumulated PTO prior to beginning approved FMLA leave. Use of paid time off will not serve to extend the length of any leave.  In addition, depending upon the circumstances, employees taking medical leave may be entitled to receive short-term disability or workers' compensation benefits, which pay a portion of normal compensation.  Under no circumstances shall an employee be allowed to utilize more than two types of paid leave at one time.</p>
<hr /><h3>Maintenance of Benefits</h3>
<p>FreshDirect will continue to maintain coverage under its benefits plans (i.e., health, long-term disability, dental) while an employee is out on an approved family/medical leave under this policy.  Coverage for employees may be extended in the discretion of FreshDirect. After the cessation of coverage, employees may continue coverage under such plans at their own expense through the provisions of COBRA.  Taking leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of the leave.</p>
<hr /><h3>Notice of Intent to Return</h3>
<p>Every 30 days of their leave, employees may be required to notify FreshDirect of their status and whether they intend to return to work after their leave. FreshDirect may seek reimbursement of benefit premiums paid for employees who fail to return from their leave for a reason other than the continuation, recurrence, or onset of: 1) a serious health condition that would entitle the employee to family or medical leave; 2) a serious injury or illness of a servicemember spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin that would entitle the employee to servicemember leave; or 3) or other situation beyond their control. </p>
<hr /><h3>Independent Medical Examinations</h3>
<p>FreshDirect reserves the right to require employees or their family members, at FreshDirect’s expense, to obtain second or third medical opinions, in order to determine the necessity of leave.</p>
<hr /><h3>Reinstatement</h3>
<p>Following an approved leave under this policy, FreshDirect will reinstate employees to their same or an equivalent position, with no loss in salary, benefits, or other terms and conditions of employment.  Employees on medical leave who are permitted to remain on leave past 12 weeks (or for servicemember leave, 26 weeks) may be reinstated to a position if practicable, which may or may not be equivalent to their prior position.  Employees who would have been affected by a reduction in force or layoff, or would have otherwise been subject to separation of employment had they not taken leave, are not entitled to reinstatement.</p>
<p>FreshDirect does not generally permit telecommuting.  In certain cases to assistn an employee’s return to work after a leave, the Company may consider 1 or 2 days per week of telecommuting for a full time employee.  In all such cases, approval of telecommuting will be at the Company’s sole discretion and will not be given to any role where telecommuting is impractical.  No telecommuting arrangement will be permiited to last for more than 6 months after reinstatement.</p>
<p>Under specified and limited circumstances where restoration to employment will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to its operations, FreshDirect reserves the right to refuse to reinstate certain highly-paid “key&quot; employees after using FMLA leave during which health coverage was maintained.  A &quot;key&quot; employee is a salaried &quot;eligible&quot; employee who is among the highest paid ten percent of employees within 75 miles of the work site.</p>
<p>Upon return to work, employees who took leave due to their own serious health condition must submit a fitness-for-duty certificate stating that they are able to perform the essential functions of their position either with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p>Employees should contact Human Resources for further information about entitlement to family/medical leave and the required procedures.</p>
