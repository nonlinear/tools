<p>Eligible employees are granted PTO over time as they work for FreshDirect.  Employees in their Introductory Period earn PTO, but they may not take it during the Introductory period except in special circumstances when approved by a supervisor.  The following PTO entitlement, all of which accrue over the course of each year, are based on length of employment for exempt and non-exempt employees, as follows:</p>
<hr /><h3>Years of 								PTO Grant</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Employment							Per Year (In Days)</li>
  <li> New hire through 3rd anniversary date (non-exempt)		10 days (80 hours)</li>
  <li> New hire through 3rd anniversary date (exempt)		15 days (120 hours)</li>
  <li> Beginning on 3rd anniversary date (all employees)		15 days (120 hours)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you work at FreshDirect for at least twelve (12) consecutive months and then leave FreshDirect for reasons other than termination for cause or voluntary resignation without providing two weeks notice, and then rejoin FreshDirect within six (6) months, you will be eligible to earn PTO at the appropriate rate as calculated from your original hire date rather than the date you rejoined FreshDirect. </p>
<hr /><h3>Use of PTO</h3>
<p>Except in some special circumstances, you will be charged for the use of one (1) PTO day for each day that you are absent for any reason, including sickness or vacation, on a normally scheduled day of work.  If you are out sick for more than one day and provide a doctor’s note upon return, you may elect not to use PTO for the 2nd and all subsequent days of that absence period.  FreshDirect will always try to let you use your accrued PTO as desired, but PTO cannot interfere with your department's operation.  If you are sick and cannot work, please inform your supervisor per the terms of these policies.  For planned vacations, you should ask your immediate supervisor to approve your time off at least one (1) month in advance.  If any conflicts arise in vacation requests, preference will be given to the employee with the longest period of continuous service.</p>
<p>Only PTO which has been earned may be taken.  You may not receive advance PTO pay (for PTO time taken in excess of your PTO balance) without written authorization from the Human Resources Department.  Such authorization is at the discretion of Human Resources and must be granted in advance of your time off.  Any amount of advance PTO paid but not yet earned at the time of termination of employment will be deducted from your final paycheck.</p>
<p>All PTO time must be taken in full day increments unless otherwise authorized in writing.  Specific PTO dates must be approved by your immediate supervisor.  Your immediate supervisor has the responsibility to maintain adequate staffing levels and has the authority to limit the approval of PTO requests in order to meet operational needs.  Requests will normally be granted as long as your absence will not seriously affect FreshDirect's operations.</p>
<p>An hourly employee who takes 5 or more days (1 week) of PTO may be paid for a full 5 days of the PTO days taken in advance of his or her absence.  To be paid in advance (on the last pay date prior to departure), a request form must be submitted to Human Resources (signed by the employee and his or her supervisor) at least 2 weeks before the advance payment is to be made.</p>
<p>An hourly employee with at least 7 days of accrued PTO (56 hours) may elect to be paid out a full week (5 days) on the pay date immediately preceding Christmas without taking any time off.  To be paid out (on the last pay date prior to Christmas), a request form must be submitted to Human Resources (signed by the employee and his or her supervisor) during the first 2 weeks of December or another time communicated to employees by the Company in advance. </p>
<p>If you are on an approved leave of absence for less than thirty (30) days, your PTO accrual eligibility will not be affected. If your approved leave of absence extends beyond thirty (30) days, PTO will not continue to accrue.</p>
<p>If you have earned but not used PTO upon the termination of your employment with FreshDirect, you will be paid for a maximum of 10 unused PTO days at that time at your regular base hourly rate unless (1) you have been terminated for violating FreshDirect rules, policies, or procedures or (2) you resigned your employment without giving FreshDirect at least two (2) weeks’ advance notice of your resignation.</p>
<hr /><h3>Carryover of Unused PTO to the Next Year</h3>
<p>Employees are encouraged to use their PTO to take regular time off each year.  If you do not take off your accrued time, unused PTO may be carried over and accumulated from year to year, but your PTO accrual will cease once your PTO account reaches twenty (20) total days of PTO.  PTO accrual will only resume as of the date that you take PTO and your account falls below twenty (20) days.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this policy may be made in unusual circumstances.  Each case will be viewed on an individual basis by management.</p>
